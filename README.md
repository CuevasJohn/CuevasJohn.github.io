### CPSC 120

* Lab 1  
       Lab 1 is one of my favorite labs because we wroked with a partner for the first time in a coding envirement. I know it wasn't much 
but even learning how to work with others is something I liked learning. We printed out "Hello World" and I felt so accomplished 
from that little line.

* Lab 8 Part 2  
        Lab 8 part 2 is another favorite of mine because we made a program that checks if numbers are prime or not. I never never knew hoe much coding goes into something that sounds so simple. We did get stuck at some point but we ended up getting through it. What surprised me was that the program worked on the first try. Nothing better than getting it right the first time.

* Lab 12 Part 1
Finally lab 12 part 1 is my favorite out of all these other labs because we create a gif of a gradient sqaure thats constantly changing colors and moving. It's crazy to create that using c++. I never knew you could make a gif in c++. Every lab I learn something new and this lab made me realize that technology has come a long way.
