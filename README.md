### CPSC 120

* Lab 1
Lab 1 is one of my favorite labs because we wroked with a partner for the first time in a coding envirement. I know it wasn't much 
but even learning how to work woth others is something I liked learning. We printed out "Hello World" and I felt so accomplished 
from that little line.
